### **Tools**

- Large mixing bowl (Dry Ingredients)
- Mixing bowl (Wet Ingrdients)
- Frying pan
- Skillet

### **Ingredients**

• 1 cup cassava flour
• 1 cup milk (dairy or non-dairy)
• 2 teaspoons baking powder
• 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
• 1 tablespoon sugar (optional, adjust to taste)
• 1/4 teaspoon salt
• 1 large egg
• 2 tablespoons oil or melted butter
• Oil or butter for cooking

```
1. Mix Dry Ingredients:
   • In a large bowl, whisk together the cassava flour, baking powder, sugar (if using), and salt.
2. Mix Wet Ingredients:
   • In another bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, vanilla extract, and oil or melted butter until well combined.
3. Combine Ingredients:
   • Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; it’s okay if there are a few lumps.
4. Heat the Pan:
   • Heat a non-stick frying pan or skillet over medium heat. Add a small amount of oil or butter to the pan to prevent the pancakes from sticking.
5. Cook the Pancakes:
   • Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan for each pancake. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side or until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set, then flip and cook until golden brown.
6. Serve:
   • Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, honey, fresh fruits, or a sprinkle of powdered sugar.
