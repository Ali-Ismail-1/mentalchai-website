### Intro

Umrah is a sacred pilgrimage to Makkah that can be performed at any time of the year, offering a unique opportunity to draw closer to Allah.

It is a deeply humbling experience, allowing pilgrims to spiritually reset through acts of obedience, love, and devotion. Many describe feeling renewed and inspired to live a better, more meaningful life upon returning. This journey is not just about physical travel but a profound spiritual transformation that leaves a lasting impact on the heart and soul.

## Medina

A visit to the Dar Al Madinah Museum adds layers of depth to your spiritual journey in Madinah. The museum immerses you in the city’s rich history, showcasing how Madinah and the Prophet’s Mosque (Masjid an-Nabawi) have evolved under various leaders. Visiting the museum before the Rawda helps you understand its exact boundaries and significance, enriching your prayers and connection to this sacred space. If you want to bring meaning and context to your visit to the Rawda and Prophet’s Mosque, the Dar Al Madinah Museum is an absolute must.

- Nusuk app

The Nusuk App is an official tool designed to simplify and enhance the Umrah experience for pilgrims. It allows you to easily apply for Umrah permits, book visits to sacred sites like the Rawda Sharif, and manage accommodations and transportation. The app provides real-time updates, prayer schedules, and spiritual guidance, ensuring a smooth and organized journey. By streamlining logistics and offering key services in one place, Nusuk allows pilgrims to focus on worship and reflection without unnecessary stress. It’s an essential companion for anyone planning their Umrah.

- Salman Al Farsi Farm

The Salman Al Farsi Farm is a historic site in Madinah that holds great significance in Islamic history. It is where Salman Al Farsi (RA), a companion of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), planted date palms as part of his agreement to gain his freedom from slavery. The Prophet (ﷺ) personally planted some of these palms, making the site a deeply spiritual and historical landmark. Visiting the farm offers a chance to connect with the legacy of the Sahaba and reflect on the values of dedication, sacrifice, and the blessed actions of the Prophet (ﷺ).

## Makkah

- Sadaqa Ijariya

The Nahdi Pharmacy, conveniently located in the Clock Tower near the Haram in Makkah, offers a unique opportunity to give Sadaqah Jariyah by donating wheelchairs and medical equipment. These donations provide essential support to those in need, allowing pilgrims and locals to perform daily tasks with dignity. It’s a meaningful way to contribute while earning ongoing rewards.

- Clock tower museum

The Clock Tower Museum, located in the upper floors of the Makkah Royal Clock Tower, offers a fascinating journey through time, astronomy, and Islamic heritage. It features exhibits on ancient timekeeping, the construction of the iconic clock, and celestial movements, alongside breathtaking panoramic views of the Grand Mosque. Visiting the museum is a unique opportunity to explore both science and spirituality in the heart of Makkah.
